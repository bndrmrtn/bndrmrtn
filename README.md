# Hey ðŸ‘‹

> I'm a 19-year-old high school student at [ESZC BottyÃ¡n JÃ¡nos secondary vocational school](https://bottyan.eu), specializing in IT Systems Administration. But honestly, my real passion is **software development**. I wrote my first program back in **2016**, using a block-based approach (similar to Scratch). Since then, coding has been an everyday part of my life.

### ðŸš€ What do I do?

> I mainly work with **Go** and **Vue.js** *(TypeScript)*. I got into Vue.js during the **2020** quarantine and quickly fell in love with it. Over the years, Iâ€™ve built many projects with it, including my personal website. Of course, frontend alone wasnâ€™t enough, so I started working with backend technologies. Initially, I used *PHP* with **Laravel**, but recently, Go has become my primary backend language due to its performance and simplicity.

> Besides these, Iâ€™m also developing my own programming language:
> [**Zx** Language](https://github.com/bndrmrtn/zxl) â€“ An interpreted scripting language for web development, featuring a built-in HTTP server and HTML template literals. ðŸš€

> I also built **[MyCloud]**(https://github.com/bndrmrtn/mycloud), a cloud storage service where users can upload, download, and manage files from anywhere via a web application.

### ðŸ¤” Why work with me?

> Learning is something I'm genuinely passionate about. Iâ€™m always working to improve my skills, not because I have to, but because I enjoy truly understanding how things work. To get a better at Go, I recently picked up a book on **100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them** to learn from common pitfalls and improve my approach. As I develop my own programming language, Iâ€™ve been diving into **lexers** and **abstract syntax trees (AST)**, which has given me a much deeper understanding of how programming languages break down and process code.
