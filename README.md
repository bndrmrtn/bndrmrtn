# Hey ðŸ‘‹

> Currently, I am a 18-year-old high school student at [ESZC BottyÃ¡n JÃ¡nos secondary vocational school](https://bottyan.eu), majoring in IT Systems Administration. However, I feel that my real passion lies in software development. I created my very first program in **2016**, similar to using blocks, just like in Scratch. But let's get to the point ðŸ˜‰

### ðŸš€ What am I skilled at?

> Currently, I work most with Laravel and Vue.js (*Typescript*) frameworks. I got into Vue.js around **2020** (during the quarantine period ðŸ˜†) and invested a lot of time into learning it. I've completed many small and large projects with it, including my personal website.

> Of course, I couldn't achieve all the ideas and projects I envisioned with just that, so I needed a backend. Ultimately, I chose PHP. I know that not many people favor this choice, but with the Laravel framework, almost anything is possible. Additionally, since I frequently used similar solutions in my projects, I also created my own *framework*, [FlameCore](https://flamephp.mrtn.vip).

> I still use the aforementioned frameworks, and I've delved into a new language, **Go**. I want to have a strongly typed language as part of my skill set.

### ðŸ¤” Why would you choose me?

> Honestly, when I learn something new, it's not the money that motivates me. Understanding and grasping new technologies is much more important to me. I love that in programming, there are countless ways to solve every problem, and I'm open to embracing the latest solutions and technologies. That's why I'm learning **Go** now. ðŸ˜Ž
